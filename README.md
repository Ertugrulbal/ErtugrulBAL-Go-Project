-We have two types Link.


Examples of Link types and equality theirself:
1. First style of Link Converting Type ( "Product ) If Url has "-p-" text we decided a this link "Product" type.
    - Web URL : "https://www.ecommerce.com/casio/saat-p-1925865?boutiqueId=439892&merchantId=105064"
    - Deep Link : "ec://?Page=Product&ContentId=1925865&CampaignId=439892&MerchantId=105064"
2. Second style of Link Converting Type ("Search"). If Url has "sr?q=" text we decided a this link "Search" type.
    - Web URL : "https://www.ecommerce.com/sr?q=%C3%BCt%C3%BC"
    - Deep Link : "ec://?Page=Search&Query=%C3%BCt%C3%BC"
3. Third style of Link Converting Type ( "Home") (Ä°f request not equal to "Product" or "Search" we call a "Home")
    - Web URL : "https://www.ecommerce.com/Hesabim/#/Siparisleri
    - Deep Link : "ec://?Page=Home"
