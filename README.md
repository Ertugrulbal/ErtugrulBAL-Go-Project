# ErtugrulBAL-Go-Project
-This Project about the Link Converting Processing

-This Project aims to convert to links each other which Web Urls to Deeplinks and Deeplinks to Web Urls 

-We have two types of links.


Examples of Link types and equality theirself:
1. First style of Link Converting Type ( "Product ) If Url has "-p-" text we decided a this link "Product" type.
    - Web URL : "https://www.ecommerce.com/casio/saat-p-1925865?boutiqueId=439892&merchantId=105064"
    - Deep Link : "ec://?Page=Product&ContentId=1925865&CampaignId=439892&MerchantId=105064"
2. Second style of Link Converting Type ("Search"). If Url has "sr?q=" text we decided a this link "Search" type.
    - Web URL : "https://www.ecommerce.com/sr?q=%C3%BCt%C3%BC"
    - Deep Link : "ec://?Page=Search&Query=%C3%BCt%C3%BC"
3. Third style of Link Converting Type ( "Home") (Ä°f request not equal to "Product" or "Search" we call a "Home")
    - Web URL : "https://www.ecommerce.com/Hesabim/#/Siparisleri
    - Deep Link : "ec://?Page=Home"

    - Controller Package has a ConvertingController.go file. This file provide us When the request come from server, directing to converting from deeplink to Web URL or convert from WebUrl to deeplink.
    
    - Converters meet the requests from the Controller and perform the converting operations.
    
    - Driver file established for DB connection as we mentioned before.
    
    - Object package have a WebUrl and Deeplink files. These files perform parceling and assigning Web Url and Deeplink requests to models.
    
    - Repository was created to store inbound and fetched links.
    
    - Utils file was created for management of errors.
    
    -.env file has stored secret DB informations. 
### V2- This code were written Gin Framework

- All of the above principle valid for this style. 
- Using Frameworks more easy to arrive result.

# We imported a these packages

-In this version we showed a simple coding style and arrive a fastly to result.
-The code has a approximately 200 raw
